A simple python script using paramiko to allow you to ssh to multiple servers at once and run commands in parallel

Usage:
Create a file with a list of hostnames/ips to connect to.
Specify this file with the -f option.
mush will ssh to each of these machines and run commands you enter at the prompt in parallel

Options:
-S 	keeps the list sorted as in the hosts file specified with -f
-c 	specifies the original command to run
-n 	will place a newline between each set of hosts results (can be 
	toggled at the prompt with #n)
-u 	set the username for the connection
-p 	will prompt you for a password (will use the same password for each connection,
	shared keys recommended)
-s 	run a single command and quit
-a 	specify an "alias" file
	- alias file is a plain text file containing a list alias's for commands
	  the first word on the line is taken as the alias and the rest of the line 
	  is taken as the command aliases can be ran by prefixing them with a #
