A simple python script using paramiko to allow you to ssh to multiple servers at once and run commands in parallel.

Usage:
Create a file with a list of hostnames/ips to connect to, e.g.:
    root@192.168.1.1
    root@192.168.1.2
    root@192.168.1.3

Specify this file with the -f option.
mush will ssh to each of these machines and run commands you enter at the prompt in parallel.

Options:
-c 	specifies the initial command to run (defaults to uptime)
-u 	set the username for the connection
-p 	will prompt you for a password (will use the same password for each connection,
	shared keys recommended)
-s 	run a single command and quit
	  
Changes in v0.7
Removed global padding variable and changed how padding variable is calculated.

Changes in v0.6
Removed global hosts variable.
Threads now call host.exec_cmd as target instead of the ssh_f function.

Fixes in v0.5
Changed the way the threading was implemented (an improvement I hope!).
Some options have been dropped during this "improvement".

Fixes in v0.4
Fixed an issue where on Ret Hat 6.2 a depreciation warning was being issued.
